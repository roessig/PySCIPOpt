Contributing to PySCIPOpt
=========================

Code contributions are very welcome and should comply to a few rules:

1. Compatibility with both Python-2 and Python-3

#. All tests defined in the Continuous Integration setup need to pass:

    - `.travis.yml <.travis.yml>`__
    - `appveyor.yml <appveyor.yml>`__

#. New features should be covered by the tests, so please extend `tests <tests>`__

#. New code should be documented in the same style as the rest of the code
